# horiseon-code-refactor

## Description

Our task for this project was to go over the HTML and CSS and make necessary corrections to make a cleaner code. We then needed to create a repo and deploy the page with our refactered code.
Some of the things required were to add an alt tag to the images and making sure all the header attributs fell in a sequential order. In addition to that, we were asked to condense some of the information as well. For example, there were classes assigned to different sections of the web page that had the same properties, so I assigned these sections with the same class to simplify the code.

I believe the importance of knowing how to refactor code to something much simpler and cleaner is a key factor that will help a developer stand our to an employer. It is not always enough to know how to code. It necessary to know how to code cleanly. By one not being organized, it makes things difficult for others to understand the code, even for the developer himself/herself.

I believe this project was pretty straight forward. The thing I learned most was how to write a good README and what needs to be included.
